# EmbeddedML-Benchmark

The main goal of this project is to implement and optimize machine learning and deep learning algorithms on embedded systems using STM32 boards. Embedded systems face unique challenges, such as hardware limitations and energy consumption, which complicate the execution of complex algorithms. With the advent of technologies like TinyML and optimized frameworks, the implementation of machine learning on these systems has become feasible.

## Tools
- Familiarity with the STM32 board and programming it
- Experience with Segger SystemView for runtime and clock cycle measurements
- Knowledge of machine learning libraries for embedded systems

### Initial Research
We will start by investigating various machine learning libraries for embedded systems like TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile, and Edge Impulse, selecting one for our project. Subsequent research will focus on the types of algorithms used in embedded systems, selecting suitable ones for implementation on the STM32 board.

### Benchmarking Design and Execution
Designing and conducting benchmark tests to evaluate the performance of these algorithms in terms of execution time and resource consumption is a primary objective of the project.

## Implementation Details

In this section, you will explain how you completed your project. It is recommended to use pictures to demonstrate your system model and implementation.


Feel free to use sub-topics for your projects. If your project consists of multiple parts (e.g. server, client, and embedded device), create a separate topic for each one.

## How to Run

In this part, you should provide instructions on how to run your project. Also if your project requires any prerequisites, mention them.
