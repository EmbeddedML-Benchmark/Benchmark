xxd -i speech_commands_model_float32.tflite model_data.h

This command uses the utility xxd to convert the binary file speech_commands_model_float32.tflite into a C header file named model_data.h.
The -i option tells xxd to output in C include file style, which creates a C array containing the binary data from the model along with a variable that holds its length.
This allows you to embed the model directly into your source code without needing to load it from external storage at runtime.
